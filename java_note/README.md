## Java_notes

Welcome to this Java project has been created as part of my exploration and learning in Java application development using Visual Studio Code. Throughout the development, I have been working on several fundamental concepts and advanced practices within the Java world.

## Project Objectives

The main objective of this project is to:

- **Review Fundamental Concepts**: I have been reviewing essential concepts such as loops, object-oriented programming (OOP) and data structures.
  
- Apply Software Design Patterns**: In addition, I have been exploring and applying software design patterns to improve architecture and code quality.

- Development Practice with Visual Studio Code**: Taking advantage of the tools provided by Visual Studio Code, I have been practising writing Java code efficiently and optimising my workflow.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
